My name is Kyle Erickson and I am a senior Technology Management student here at Texas A&amp;amp;M. I was born and raised in College Station and have lived here my whole life. I have been able to see plenty of people come and go out this townn over the years especially through the athletic programs. Still hopeful one of these days A&amp;amp;M will obtain a modern national championship trophy and national title in football.</description></item></channel></rss>
