Howdy! My name is Viet Lam and I'm a Junior in Technology Management at Texas A&M University. I was born in Houston, Texas and have lived there my whole life. My family was all born in vietnam and came to US about 20 years ago. I know how to speak vietnamese but only enough to speak to my parents because growing up, I learned how to speak english and have been speaking english for basically my entire life.

I enrolled into the Technology Mangement major at Texas A&M University because of the culture the school provides and hope to pursue my future in the IT/Cybersecurity field. I love being apart of this culture because it makes me feel like I've found my home and that I belong to a community that is supportive of my academic accomplishment. This semester I just ordered my ring and I look forward to wearing it when I receive it on ring day.

In my free time, I love to hang out with my friends, play sports, workout at the rec, hike, play basketball and watch football/basketball. Also in the future, I hope to travel around the world and experience all types of culture that haven't yet. Some of the places I hope to visit soon are Korea, Japan, and any place in Europe.
