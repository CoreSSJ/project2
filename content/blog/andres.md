Howdy! My name is Andres Mena and I am a senior Technology Management student at Texas A&M and a member of the Corps of Cadets.
I am from Del Rio, TX which is a small town on the border with Mexico, southwest of San Antonio.

After I graduate I plan on commissioning as a lieutenant into the Marine Corps, hopefully as an intelligence officer. This summer I plan on doing an internship with an IT company so I can get some more hands on experience. 

My hobbies are playing video games, working out, and playing my guitar. I have also started working on making time to read more books this year.
