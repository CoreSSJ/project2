Howdy! My name is Kyle Erickson and I am a senior Technology Management student here at Texas A&M. I was born and raised in College Station and have lived here my whole life. I have been able to see plenty of people come and go out this townn over the years especially through the athletic programs. Still hopeful one of these days A&M will obtain a modern national championship trophy and national title in football.

In my spare time I enjoy watching pro sports mainly football and basketball but will also watch hockey and baseball. I also enjoy weight lifting, playing video games, and playing paintball when I get the chance. After graduation my goal is to work for a company such as GM, Tesla, Google, or Microsoft in a cyber security role preferably.
