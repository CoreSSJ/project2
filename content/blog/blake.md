Howdy!

My name is Blake Taber, and I am currently a junior TCMG student here at Texas A&M. I am from a town called Wylie, which is just on the northeast side of Dallas.

After graduation, I'm wanting to move out of the country, ideally to somewhere in western Europe, but would be open to other experiences as well.
I don't have a particular dream job, but would be interested in database administration. 

Outside of my professional goals, I enjoy playing video games and hanging out with my cat, Cheddar.
