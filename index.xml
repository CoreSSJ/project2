My name is Blake Taber, and I am currently a junior TCMG student here at Texas A&amp;amp;M. I am from a town called Wylie, which is just on the northeast side of Dallas. After graduation, I&amp;rsquo;m wanting to move out of the country, ideally to somewhere in western Europe, but would be open to other experiences as well. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a particular dream job, but would be interested in database administration.</description></item><item><title>Bradly</title><link>https://CoreSSJ.github.io/project2/blog/bradly/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Feb 2022 00:48:47 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://CoreSSJ.github.io/project2/blog/bradly/</guid><description>Howdy

My name is Corey Whitfield and I am a senior here at Texas A&amp;amp;M University. I came to this university to enroll in the Technology Management program so I can pursue a career as a Database Administrator. The reason why I want to be a Database Administrator is because I enjoy the complexity of dealing with SQL queries. I took a Database course last semester and I have to admit that I had fun trying to figure out the most simplistic but yet complicated problem.</description></item><item><title>Kyle</title><link>https://CoreSSJ.github.io/project2/blog/kyle/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Feb 2022 00:48:47 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://CoreSSJ.github.io/project2/blog/kyle/</guid><description>Howdy!</description></item><item><title>Viet</title><link>https://CoreSSJ.github.io/project2/blog/viet/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Feb 2022 00:48:47 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://CoreSSJ.github.io/project2/blog/viet/</guid><description/></item><item><title>End of the road</title><link>https://CoreSSJ.github.io/project2/blog/end/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://CoreSSJ.github.io/project2/blog/end/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
